Notes on the Chubby lock service

Introduction:
Chubby is a lock service for distributed systems with moderately large numbers of
machines. The clients of a chubby cell are often colocated in the same data centre
or machine room. The lock service allows clients to synchronize activities and
agree on environment information. The primary goal of chubby is realiability,
availability and large sets of clients. Throughput and storage capacity were
secondary considerations.

Chubby enables coarse grain synchronization in their systems. One example is
leader election from among an other wise equal set of servers. Clients in a
google file system use chubby locks to determine a leader. GFS and BigTable
use chubby to store small amounts of metadata this metadata is the root of
the distributed data structures these tools operate on. For instance GFS might
store the GFS equivalent of a superblock in chubby (I'm guessing). Chubby
enables dynamic leader election.. like Square would like to have as opposed to
have a hard-coded leader and requiring some sort of intervention if the leader
goes down.
