Up and down the levels of abstraction

A system model: properties of distributed systems
- programs run concurrently on independent nodes
- nodes are connected by a lossy network
- no shared memory or clock

Implications of these properties:
- Each node exectures a program concurrently
- Knowledge is local; information from the network may be out of date
- nodes can fail and recover from failure independently
- messages may not reach their destination or may take an inordinate amount of
  time to reach their destination
- clocks are not synchronized across nodes; local time stamps mean nothing on
  other nodes

System models enumerate the assumptions made regarding how a particular system
will operate.

Important questions about a system:
- In what ways can nodes fail?
- How is network performance?
- properties of the system such as assumptions about time and order

The weaker the assumptions the closer the system will be to reality. However this
makes it harder to reason about the system.


Model of nodes in a system:
Nodes are hosts for computation and storage. Nodes can execute a program and are capable
of storing data in both volatile and stable memory. Nodes also have a clock which is
presumed to be inaccurate

Communication between nodes:
If the network were perfect nodes could always be expected to arrive in order. However
in the real world it is more likely the network will be unreliable. Messages may arrive
out of order or not at all.

Network Partition:
When the network fails but the nodes do not. This means a client may make a request to a
node that can't communicate with the rest of the network. This node may serve stale data
or hang.

Timing:
Systems are typically modelled in two ways:
    - Synchronous: processes execute in lock-step and there is a known upper bound on
      transmission delay
    - Asynchronous: clocks don't exist; process execute at independent rates and there
      is no bound on message transmission time

Real world systems are at best partially synchronous
