Up and down the levels of abstraction

A system model: properties of distributed systems
- programs run concurrently on independent nodes
- nodes are connected by a lossy network
- no shared memory or clock

Implications of these properties:
- Each node exectures a program concurrently
- Knowledge is local; information from the network may be out of date
- nodes can fail and recover from failure independently
- messages may not reach their destination or may take an inordinate amount of
  time to reach their destination
- clocks are not synchronized across nodes; local time stamps mean nothing on
  other nodes

System models enumerate the assumptions made regarding how a particular system
will operate.

Important questions about a system:
- In what ways can nodes fail?
- How is network performance?
- properties of the system such as assumptions about time and order

The weaker the assumptions the closer the system will be to reality. However this
makes it harder to reason about the system.
