- The network is reliable
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite
- The network is secure
- Topology doesnt change
- There is one admin
- Transport cost is zero
- The network is homogeneous

Effects of the afformentioned fallacies
- Ignorance of network latency causes people to think less about how to control traffic
  leading to an increase in packet loss
- Ignoring network security leaves the system unprepared for maliciuous users
- Multiple administrators for networks your traffic must cross may set different rules
  regarding timeouts and stuff for packets. You must be aware of these rules to ensure
  your traffic goes where you expect
